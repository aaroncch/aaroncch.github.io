            Hon,
            <br>
            <br>
            Do you still remember the first time we talked to each other? It was really awkward! We first met each other as classmates when we were grade 11. I find it awkward to start a conversation with you since I am having a difficult time dealing with girls. The moment I saw you, I had already find you attractive. But, it just made me more difficult to approach you. As time passes by, we still haven't talked to each other untill the last few weeks of the third term. It was due to the class project in out ArtAppre class when we first talked to each other. I can feel my heart beat so fast and I was blushing at that time. It was also around that time that I learned that you also like me. With our friends' encouragement, I finally gathered my guts to ask you out to be my date in our prom. It was February 15, when I asked you to be my prom date. I find you really cute when you have already nodded to be my date even though I haven't asked you yet. I'm really happy that you agreed to be my date. It was my first time to ask someone out for a date, to attend a prom, and to dance so I was also glad that you didn't dislike me. You were really beautiful that night! It was a memorable night, I had a lot of fun with you. Since then, we got to talk to each other more and we got to hang out more. The more I knew you, the more I got fond of you. It was a sad thing that we didn't get to be classmates during our stay in grade 12 but we got to a lot of stuff more! I may not express my feelings everyday, I want you to know that you are someone special to me. Thank you for always making up my day. Thank you for your support in my gaming and anime stuffs. Thank you for brightening my life. Thank you for completing me. I love you always.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yours,
            <br>
